# NetherDelta
https://amis-erc20.github.io/netherdelta

A cleaner, freshened up and enhanced take on EtherDelta &amp; ForkDelta

  Note: The ability to create/import private keys has been taken out from the UI. The lack of mnemonic seeds or a wizard to confirm a backup was made is too suboptimal to include in good faith. Until a better method is implemented, this exchange will strictly utilize MetaMask & Ledger wallets.

Although the UI is different, this exchange still uses the same smart contracts deployed by EtherDelta and ForkDelta's back-end.
